# Libarary-Management-System
This is a Java-based library management system designed to help users manage their library resources easily and efficiently.

# Installation and Setup
To run the program, you will need to have the following software installed on your device:

  Mysql Workbench 8.0
  Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or higher
  
Additionally, you will need to have the JDBC driver installed and configured properly to connect to the MySQL database. The username and password for the database are set to "Mysql Workbench 8.0".

# Project Structure
The project is organized into several folders:

  The code folder contains all the code used in the project, including the Java classes, controller class, FXML classes, and pictures used in the project. It also contains a RAR file with the entire project inside.
  The Documentation folder contains documentation that describes the entire project and explains the OOP concepts, data storage, and project structure design we used.
  The Jar File folder contains the executable JAR file.
  The UML folder contains two UML diagrams for the Library Management System - one without the controller class and one with the controller class.

# How to Use
Once you have the program running, you will be able to perform various library management tasks such as adding, editing, and deleting books, managing members, and borrowing and returning books.

You will be able to navigate through the different options in the program using a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that makes it easy to manage your library resources.
